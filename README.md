# Advanced-Computer-Networks-Routing
## Overview
This project is part of the **Advanced Computer Networks (ENCS5321)** course. It involves the design, configuration, and implementation of a complex network topology using multiple **Autonomous Systems (ASes)** with routing protocols such as **OSPF, RIP, and BGP**. The project also covers **traffic engineering, route filtering, policy-based routing, and load balancing** to optimize network performance.

## Instructor  
**Dr. Imad Tartir**  

## Features & Configurations
- **Network Topology:** Multi-AS hierarchical design.
- **Routing Protocols Implemented:**
  - **RIP** for AS200 and AS400.
  - **OSPF** for AS100 and AS300.
  - **BGP (eBGP & iBGP)** for inter-AS routing.
- **Traffic Engineering:**
  - Outbound traffic manipulation using **Local Preference**.
  - Inbound traffic control using **AS_PATH Prepending**.
- **Routing Techniques:**
  - **Route Filtering**
  - **Load Balancing**
  - **Policy-Based Routing**
- **Network Verification:**
  - Successful **ping tests** within and across ASes.
